# Weak-Learners-vs-Strong-Learners-with-AdaBoost-Scikit-learn-Tutorial-
Boosting in Action: Comparing Weak Learners, AdaBoost, and Strong Learners (Random Forest) using Python and Scikit-learn.

This project demonstrates the fundamental concept behind **Boosting**: how combining multiple **weak learners** (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) can produce a **strong learner**.

We explore and compare:

- 🎲 **Random Guessing** using `DummyClassifier`
- 🪓 **Weak Learner**: A simple decision stump (`DecisionTreeClassifier` with `max_depth=1`)
- 🔥 **AdaBoost**: An ensemble of 50 weak learners
- 🌲 **Strong Learner**: A deep `RandomForestClassifier`

## 📈 What You'll Learn

- How AdaBoost uses weak learners to improve performance
- How strong learners compare to boosting-based ensembles
- Code implementation using `scikit-learn`
- Accuracy comparison across models

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
